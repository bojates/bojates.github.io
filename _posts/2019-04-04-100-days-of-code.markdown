## Rules
####  I will code for at least one hour every week day for the next 100 days

1. I will keep a log and push it to GitHub every day
2. If I miss a day, it will be added to the end of the challenge
3. Reading articles doesn't count. I must actually be coding on a project or working through solutions. 
4. Paid work projects don't count. 

## Log
### Day 1: 8 April, 2019 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Advanced problem: stars in a diamond. Tried timing it, and managed the first pass at the solution in 15 mins. Refactored for about 45 further mins, and looked at other solutions. 

**Thoughts**: I forgot about the center method, which would have provided another solution. The main challenge was trying to make the code clear with variable naming.

### Day 2: 9 April, 2019 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Advanced problems: transposing matrixes. Took 15 mins for each one to get to a working solution, then spent time refactoring and looking the provided solutions. 

**Thoughts**: The mixture of `each_with_index` alongside a nested `map` is quite tricky to get used to. Once I'm in one mode of thought about how to handle some data, I seem to stick with it. I used `each_with_index` quite a lot, but the solutions used `0...range_limit` and `map` which works. A solution using `range_limit.times` also works. I'm not sure how best to choose between these different approaches, but am always aiming for clarity as much as possible, so that feels like a good starting point.

### Day 3: 10 Apr, 2019 (Weds)

**Today's Progress**: Advanced problems. Rotating matrices and then fixing a bug. Fix the bug took about 30 mins because I spent quite a while trying to work out why the return value was nil. I didn't manage to work it out, but the explanation at LS made total sense.

**Thoughts**: It didn't even occur to me that Ruby would go to the next line for the evaluation of the `if`, `elsif`, `else` statement. I'm not sure why, but it is quite intuitive, as Ruby is quite forgiving about line breaks.

### Day 4: 11th April, 2019 (Thurs)

**Today's Progress**: Advanced problem merging arrays in sorted order, without using sort. V. tricky. Took about 30 mins to get a working version, then a further 25 or so looking at other solutions. Then CodeWars: 1 at level 7 and a couple at level 6. 

**Thoughts**: I seem able to reach solutions, but they aren't always the nicests, cleanest ones. CodeWars seems fun, but it's a little bit confusing at the moment.
